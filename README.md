### AI-Powered Study Assistant - Next.js UI Implementation

I've created a modern, responsive UI for AI-powered study assistant using Next.js and shadcn/ui components. This implementation will include all the features specified while providing a clean, intuitive user experience.

```typescriptreact project="study_assistant"
...
```

## Key Features Implemented

I've created a comprehensive Next.js application for AI-powered study assistant with all these features:

### 1. Authentication Flow

- Login page with email and password fields
- Simulated authentication for the MVP
- Session-based login persistence


### 2. Main Dashboard

- Sidebar navigation with all requested sections
- Clean, modern UI with statistics and recent activity


### 3. Upload Notes Section

- File upload interface for .txt and .pdf files
- Subject tagging with dropdown selection
- Simulated AI processing with loading states


### 4. Subject-Wise Progress Tracking

- Expandable UI for viewing summaries and flashcards by subject
- Tab-based interface to switch between summaries and flashcards
- Clean visualization of learning materials


### 5. Profile Tab

- Displays user information, statistics, and recent activity
- Shows total notes uploaded and subjects covered
- Visual representation of the user's learning journey


### 6. Theme Toggle

- Light/Dark mode toggle in the sidebar
- Consistent styling across both themes


### Technical Implementation

The application is built with:

- **Next.js App Router** for modern routing and layouts
- **shadcn/ui components** for a polished, accessible UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **React hooks** for state management
- **Lucide React icons** for consistent iconography


The sidebar component is based on the shadcn sidebar pattern , providing a collapsible navigation experience that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

To use this application:

1. Install the code using the "add to codebase" button
2. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application
